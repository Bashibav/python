     The average age of a ###### varies between 35 and 40 years.
 However, we know cases where ######s have reached the age of 50.
You are able to determine how old a ###### is ###, by observing the #####. 
Young ######s have oval #####. On growing older the ##### change from triangular to round.
 So, older ######s have round ##### seen from above.
 A ###### becomes an adult when it is five. Only the stallion gets a wisdom tooth. ##### Old animals get “bags” on their eyes. 
The older the animal is, the deeper the pouches are.
